analysis of Medicare Hospital Acquired Condition Penalty FY2015

R markdown file (HAC.Rmd) will include R code to conduct analysis, which will utilize five (5) csv data files. Four of them are included in the master directory for download, however the fifth is proprietary/suppressed for privacy purposes.

HAC.html just renders better on GitHub, so I included it as well for easier reading.
